@moduledef{Kernel services}
  @short Hardware independent kernel services
  @order 99

  This module provides base kernel services which are not hardware
  dependent. This includes a context scheduler, some synchronization
  primitives as well as a memory allocator.

  Some system services like, POSIX threads, file system and networking
  support are provided by separate libraries.

  The following topics are covered:
  @list
    @foreach hid hname htype {header} {+Kernel services} {1}
      @group
        @insert {@hid@} decl_short_desc, provided by the @ref {@hid@} {@hname@} header.
      @end group
    @end foreach
  @end list

@end moduledef
