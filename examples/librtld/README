This example works for mips/soclib and emu, according to the config file used.
Use the img_?.bin according to your arch.

For both arch, the img.bin contains the following files:
a.x
b.x
c.x
libc.so

You can test the runtime loader with those commands:

[lua:/] exec("A.X","a1") /* launch funtion a1 of program A.X */
[lua:/] exec("A.X","a2") /* launch funtion a2 of program A.X */
[lua:/] exec("B.X","b")
[lua:/] exec("C.X","c")
