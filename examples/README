Required tools
==============

Building MutekH requires the following software packages:

  * A GNU compiler or cross-compiler, use tools/crossgen.mk to get one
  * A perl interpreter

Some builds may require the following tools

  * The flattened device tree compiler (dtc): http://git.jdl.com/gitweb/
  * The heterogeneous linker found in tools/hlink/

You may need real hardware or a simulator to run MutekH:

  * http://www.qemu.org/ to try native x86 binaries
  * https://www.soclib.fr/ to experiment with various multiprocessor platforms


Building examples
=================

Each example comes with its own config file which is used to configure
the MutekH kernel build. This file contains application specific
configuration to enable kernel features.

Some other configuration options are related to target
architecture. Some ready to use configuration sets for specific
targets are factored in the common/ directory. These configuration
files are organized in sections that can be enabled from the build
command line. Look at the chosen example/config file to determine if
it uses a custom configuration file or it relies on these common
configuration sets.

Here are make invocations for various target architectures to build
examples which are using common configuration files:


  * As unix process (no hardware needed), on x86_64 machine running Linux:

    $ make CONF=examples/hello/config BUILD=emu-linux-x86_64


  * Pc, x86 machine boot image

    $ make CONF=examples/hello/config BUILD=ibmpc-x86


  * For SoCLib simulator, Mips32 Little endian, for
    caba-vgmn-mutekh_soclib_tutorial or
    caba-vgmn-mutekh_kernel_tutorial platforms:

    $ make CONF=examples/hello/config BUILD=soclib-mips32el:pf-tutorial


  * Heterogeneous builds for SoCLib simulator, Mips32 LE and Arm processors for
    caba-vgmn-mutekh_kernel_tutorial platform:

    $ make kernel-het CONF=examples/hello_het/config BUILD=pf-het EACH=soclib-mips32el:soclib-arm
