This examples uses the I2C slave class to emulate behavior of a M24xx
EEPROM:

- 2-byte offset address,
- write at arbitrary locations,
- full write possible.

It could be tested with Crobe and Proby:

$ python3 -m crobe.cmd.write -e 'pro/i2c/eeprom(addr_bytes=2,size=1024,saddr=0x2a,page_size=32)' -t 0 foo.bin
$ python3 -m crobe.cmd.read -e 'pro/i2c/eeprom(addr_bytes=2,size=1024,saddr=0x2a,page_size=32)' -t 0 foo2.bin
