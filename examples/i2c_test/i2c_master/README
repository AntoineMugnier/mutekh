This application tests an I2C driver with help of Proby FPGA board.

Proby needs to be loaded with i2c_test app bitstream.  On proby side,
P50 (P3.17) is SCL, P48 (P3.15) is SDA.  Don't forget to put your
master board VCC on Proby's level shifter reference voltage pin (P3.1)

When used with Nordic development kit boards, a custom board
definition is appended to bare board definition and instanciates an
I2C controller on fixed pins.
