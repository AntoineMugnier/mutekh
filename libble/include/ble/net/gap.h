   @short Network layer definition for Generic Access Profile

   This layer is not a layer per-se, but implements parts of the GAP
   behavior for devices.

   In particular, this layer tries to enforce connection parameters if
   they are declared in the attached GATT DB.

   This layer is expected to be bound to LLCP in the stack.

   There is a generic implementation of this layer in the library that
   can be created through @ref ble_gap_create.
