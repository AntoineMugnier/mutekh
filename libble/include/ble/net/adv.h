/**
   @file
   @module {Libraries::Bluetooth Low Energy}
   @short Network layer definition for Advertiser

   This header defines Network Layer API for advertiser.  This layer
   should be implemented by device drivers.

   Advertising layer needs @ref {ble_advertiser_param_s}
   {advertisement parameters} among which:
   @list
   @item Advertising interval window timers,
   @item Local address,
   @item Advertising data (AD),
   @item Advertising packet type to send.
   @end list

   Parameters can be updated while the layer is alive.

   If advertisement is connectable, advertiser layer may notify its
   delegate for connection request through
   @ref{ble_advertiser_delegate_vtable_s::connection_requested}{relevant
   vtable entry}.
