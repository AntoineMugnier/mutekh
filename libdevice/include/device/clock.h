   @short Device clock and power graph

   This header provides functions designed to manage power and clock
   supplied to a device. This API is designed to be used from any
   device drivers where managing incoming clock and power signals is
   needed.

   Physical clock and power signal connections points are represented
   in the software by source endpoint (@ref dev_clock_src_ep_s) and
   sink endpoint (@ref dev_clock_sink_ep_s) objects allocated in
   device private data by the drivers. The former are handled by clock
   and power provider devices while the latter are handled by clock
   and power consumer devices.

   This API provides gating, throttling and frequency notification
   features only for the clock and power signals associated to the
   sink endpoints owned by the consumer device.

   @section {Endpoints setup in device drivers}

   Endpoints are linked together dynamically when the device drivers
   which own the sink endpoint calls the @ref dev_drv_clock_init on
   initialization. Endpoint links will match actual hardware
   connections as described using @ref DEV_RES_CLK_SRC device
   resources attached to the clock consumer device.

   Depending on the flags passed to the function, some clock and power
   signals may be enabled on initialization (see below). Moreover the
   device driver may learn the current frequency of the input clock
   signal.

   In order to simplify drivers code, an empty @ref dev_clock_src_ep_s
   structure along with dummy implementations of the @ref
   dev_drv_clock_init and the @ref dev_drv_clock_cleanup functions are
   also available when the @ref #CONFIG_DEVICE_CLOCK token is not
   defined.

   @csee dev_clock_sink_link
   @csee dev_clock_sink_unlink
   @end section

   @section {Enabling clock and power signals}

   Depending on the hardware, some gates may only be enabled
   asynchronously. In this case, the device driver will have to handle
   delayed gate enabling events. This also applies when signals
   are enabled at link time (on driver initialization).

   Once linked, the sink endpoint owned by the driver of the consumer
   device can be used in various ways:

   @list @item When @ref #CONFIG_DEVICE_CLOCK_GATING is defined, clock
   and power signals gating can be requested by calling the @ref
   dev_clock_sink_gate function. In the other case, gates can only be
   enabled at endpoint link time and are left enabled until the
   endpoint is unlinked.

   @item When @ref #CONFIG_DEVICE_CLOCK_THROTTLE is defined,
   predefined clock throttling modes can be advised by calling the
   @ref dev_clock_sink_throttle function.

   @item Device drivers can not trigger frequency changes which would
   impact other devices. However, when the clock manager hardware
   provide a frequency scaler for the specific signal associated to
   the endpoint, the @ref dev_clock_sink_scaler_set function may be
   used. This function is useful when the only prescaler available is
   on the clock manager side, for instance for the baud rate generator
   of an UART.
   @end list

   @end section

   @section {Source endpoints}

   Unlike sink endpoints which may belong to any kind of device,
   source endpoints are owned by clock provider devices which
   implement the @ref DRIVER_CLASS_CMU driver API defined in @ref
   {@device/class/cmu.h}.

   @end section

   @section {Device clocking modes and sink endpoints}

   Device drivers may define a set of clocking modes.  Meaning and
   count of said modes is device-specific.  With @ref
   #CONFIG_DEVICE_CLOCK_THROTTLE enabled, devices may dynamically
   change clocking mode for each sink endpoint.  A mapping from device
   clocking mode to peer CMU device configuration IDs is defined in
   the device resources, see @ref #DEV_STATIC_RES_CLOCK_MODES.

   This way, a device driver defines its behavioral modes, and
   platform designer defines the mapping between device modes and
   acceptable peer CMU device configuration.  Each sink endpoint list
   compatible clocking configurations, CMU driver takes the one
   matching all the requirements.

   Mode selection is done asynchronously and sink endpoints will be
   notified of clock changes through usual clock notification ways,
   see @ref DEV_USE_CLOCK_SINK_FREQ_CHANGED and @ref
   DEV_CLOCK_EP_FREQ_NOTIFY.
