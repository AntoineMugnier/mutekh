   @file
   @module {Core::Devices support library}
   @short Value IO driver class
   @index {Value IO} {Device classes}
   @csee DRIVER_CLASS_VALIO

   @section{Purpose}
   The @em {Value IO} class gives access to a set of values exposed by
   a device. The class allows getting, setting and registering for
   events on a value. However, the byte size, format, unit and
   encoding of the exposed values are not specified in the class
   itself. This class is especially relevant for sensors and
   actuators. This class should only be used to handle low bandwidth
   transfer of physical values.

   The device may expose several different values which are identified
   using attributes. A device supports a fixed set of attributes. Each
   attribute is defined by its constant identifier, its fixed byte
   size for the value and its set of supported operations.

   Several operations can be performed on an attribute by submitting
   the appropriate @ref dev_valio_rq_s {request} to the driver: @ref
   DEVICE_VALIO_READ {reading}, @ref DEVICE_VALIO_WRITE {writing} or
   @ref DEVICE_VALIO_WAIT_EVENT {waiting for an event} on a
   value. The driver is free to support requests depending on the
   operation and attribute identifier.
   @end section

   @section{Wrong use}
   This class may not be appropriate in some cases:
   @list
     @item Accessing attribute values may be used to control
     actuators, or even set configuration parameters. Yet it must not
     be used to implement a control mechanism where accessing a value
     will be interpreted as a command not related to a physical
     value. For instance, it can not be used to read a firmware
     revision or setup a low power mode of the device. Nonetheless, it
     can be used to set a motor position, set a led intensity, setup a
     value range or handle calibration of the device.

     @item This class is not appropriate for streaming samples at some
     fixed data rate. In particular, the user may query values in a
     loop but the driver is never required to provide the value in
     constant time. Moreover, only instantaneous or cumulative values
     can be reported; no fifo can be used to keep some old unread
     values. In other words, close enough read requests are likely to
     return the same value.

     @item Size of values must be fixed at compile time and can not
     vary at runtime. That's why the request does not include a
     size field.

     @item It must not be used just because no other device class is
     fitting. An new class should be created when the purpose does not
     match the scope of the @em {Value IO} class described here.
   @end list
   @end section

   @section{Defining new attributes}
   Attributes are defined globally at compile time.
   Defining an attribute implies:
   @list
     @item choosing a numerical identifier,
     @item specifying the set of supported operations,
     @item defining a C structure used to store the value,
     @item optionally defining a different C structure used to
       store the result of @ref DEVICE_VALIO_WRITE {write} operations,
     @item optionally defining a C structure used to store the
       parameters for @ref DEVICE_VALIO_READ {read} operations,
     @item optionally defining a C structure used to store the
       condition for the @ref DEVICE_VALIO_WAIT_EVENT {event}
       condition.
   @end list
   @end section

   @section{Generic attributes}

   As explained previously, the device class does not enforce any
   specific format on values, attributes or operation availability.
   It is designed as a generic value accessor API between some devices
   and the user code. However, the device driver and the user code
   need to use a common representation of the values.

   Some libraries may define their own attributes, but some common
   attribute definitions are provided by @tt libdevice.

   Some attribute identifiers are defined along with data encoding for
   some specific usages. Using these attributes allows
   interchangeability of devices of the same type. These are available
   from the following headers:

   @list
   @foreach id name type {header} {+Core::Devices support library::Valio device attributes} {0}
     @group
       @ref @id@ {@name@} : @insert {@id@} decl_short_desc
     @end group
   @end foreach
   @end list

   Any library or application developer who does not see fit in
   existing attribute definition is free to define its own attributes.

      relevant and any request with a satisfied condition must
      terminate immediately. This operation never interferes with read
      and write requests.

      When the @ref DEVICE_VALIO_READ operation is relevant for the

      specified in @tt data field of the request. In this case, it
      must point to a buffer large enough to store the retrieved
      value.

      Depending on the attribute, the data pointer of the request may
      also be used to specify the condition. This is not relevant when
      the attribute rather relies on a change notification.

      The request may terminate with the @tt -ENOTSUP error if either
      the attribute or operation is not supported. The driver may
