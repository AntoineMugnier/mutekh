  @short I2C slave controller driver API
  @index {I2C slave controller} {Device classes}
  @csee DRIVER_CLASS_I2C_SLAVE

  This class handles implementing an I2C slave device.

  @section {I2C slave driver API}

  Times where an I2C device must take action are:
  @list
  @item Start, when slave is selected by its address;
  @item Receive transfers, when slave receives data, slave acknowledges
        bytes received;
  @item Transmit transfers, when slave send data, master acknowledges
        bytes received.
  @end list

  I2C slave class provides three request types to handle these situations:
  @list
  @item Slave selection request expects a matching address
        selection. It triggers after successful (i.e. i2c START
        condition followed by matching slave address byte,
        acknowledged).

  @item Transmit request, sends data buffer to master (i.e. matches a
        read transaction). Request terminates on a STOP condition, a
        START condition or complete transfer of the buffer.

  @item Receive request, receives a data buffer from master (i.e. matches
        a write transaction). Request terminates on a STOP condition,
        a START condition or complete transfer of the buffer.
  @end list

  STOP condition is implicitly signalled through cancellation of
  pending Transmit and Receive requests.  This is because master has
  no requirement for issuing a STOP condition on a bus (STOP is a
  multi-master event for signalling release of the bus, not a
  slave-related event).

  RESTART condition is a START not preceded by a STOP.  For slave
  device user code to handle this case correctly, driver should accept
  a pending Slave selection request at the same time Transmit and
  Receive requests are served.

  After slave address is matched and slave device is active on the
  bus, device driver should clock-stretch the bus while waiting for
  subsequent Receive or Transmit requests to be pushed by calling
  code.

  For hardware able to implement it, drivers may accept
  @list
  @item Slave selection request with an address mask allowing for
        spanning the slave device on more than one address.
  @item multiple Slave selection request with different address. The
        matching one will be signalled. The others will be kept
        enqueued.  Only the calling code that is selected has ability
        to push Transfer requests.
  @end list

  @end section

  @section {Example use cases}

  @section {I2C EEPROM}

  An I2C EEPROM with 2 address bytes handles two type of transactions:

  @list
  @item Writes, where device receives 2 address bytes followed by an
        arbitrary data buffer, in one write transaction;
  @item Reads, where device receives a write transaction of 2 address
        bytes followed by a read transaction of an arbitrary amomunt
        of bytes. Between these two transactions, a STOP condition may
        or may not be issued.
  @end list

  This can be implemented the following way:
  @list
  @item Code pushes a Slave selection request;
  @item Request is satisfied with a write transaction signalled;
  @item Code pushes 3 requests:
    @list
    @item the Slave selection request again,
    @item a Data Receive request with a 2-byte buffer,
    @item a Data Receive request with a 128-byte buffer,
    @end list
  @item If master was preparing a write transaction:
    @list
    @item first Data Receive request will be satisfied after second byte of data,
    @item second Data Receive request will be satisfied after a STOP, a START, or full buffer.
    @item code would be able to double-buffer with two requests in order to handle infinite data streams in an optimal manner.
    @end list
  @item If master was preparing a read transaction:
    @list
    @item first Data Receive request will be satisfied after second byte of data,
    @item second Data Receive request will be terminated because the master issues a START condition,
    @item Slave selection request will be satisfied with a read transaction signalled,
    @item Code pushes Data Transmit request with relevant data.
    @end list
  @end list
