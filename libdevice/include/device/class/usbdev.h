/**
  USB device class request() function type. Post a request on an USB device
  driver. There can be only one single request active at the same time on an
  endpoint.

  When a request is posted on driver, this function must return 0 if request
  processing is done immediately. If the request is processed later or if an
  interrupt must be waited to terminate the request, this function must return
  -EAGAIN. In this case, when the request will be terminated, the driver will
  have to call the @ref usbdev_stack_request_done function.

  A USB CONTROL transfer involves multiple stages and multipe transactions.
  Up to 3 stages are necessary. The first stage will retrieve setup packet.
  If there is a data stage, the next stage will retrieve or send data packet(s)
  depending on direction of control transfer. The last stage is the status stage.

   No data stage:
@code R
SETUP | STATUS IN

SETUP | STATUS IN STALL
@end code
   With DATA IN stage
@code R
SETUP | DATA IN | DATA IN | ... | STATUS OUT

SETUP | DATA IN | DATA IN | ... | STATUS OUT STALL

SETUP | DATA IN | ... | DATA IN STALL
@end code

   With DATA OUT stage
@code R
SETUP | DATA OUT | DATA OUT | ... | STATUS IN

SETUP | DATA OUT | DATA OUT | ... | STATUS IN STALL

SETUP | DATA OUT | ... | DATA OUT STALL
@end code

  All other transfer types involve only one DATA stage consisting of one or more
  USB transactions. For ISOCHRONOUS transfers the @ref DEV_USBDEV_DATA_OUT_STALL
  and @ref DEV_USBDEV_DATA_IN_STALL can not be used.

  For endpoint 0 and only for this endpoint, each on-going transfer can be
  terminated prematurely if an event is detected on bus or if the device is
  stopped. In this case, request is terminated with -EIO error. It is the
  responsability of the driver to end properly the on-going transfer on endpoint
  0 when a event occurs so that any new transfer on this endpoint can be processed
  normally.

  If a transfer is running on an endpoint and this endpoint is unconfigured due
  to a switch to an interface alternate configuration, the @ref
  usbdev_stack_request_done is called and @ref dev_usbdev_rq_s::error field is
  set to -EAGAIN.

  Each control endpoint must always have a active request for incoming setup
  packet. If no SETUP request is active when a SETUP packet arrives, it is the
  responsability of the driver to keep the packet until the next SETUP request.
  At device start-up, a request is pushed on control endpoint 0 to retrieve initial
  setup packet from host.

  For CONTROL DATA stage, BULK and INTERRUPT transactions, if there is no active
  request on the corresponding endpoint, the driver is in charge of sending the
  NAK token in response to the DATA stage transaction from host.

  For isochronous endpoints, if a packet has been dropped because no request
  has been posted in time, @ref dev_usbdev_rq_s::error field will be set to
  @tt -ETIMEDOUT on the next request posted on this endpoint.

  @list
    @item @tt -EAGAIN: If returned when posting request, this means that request
    will terminate later. If returned with @ref usbdev_stack_request_done for
    endpoints other than 0, this means that endpoint has been deconfigured and
    transfer aborted.
    @item @tt -EIO: Only for endpoint 0. A event has occured on device.
    @item @tt -ETIMEDOUT: Returned with @ref usbdev_stack_request_done only. A
    packet has been dropped on an isochronous endpoint.
    @item @tt -EPIPE: Returned with @ref usbdev_stack_request_done only. USB
    connection has been lost and transfer is aborted.
