/** @This configures some PWM channels. The first channel to configure
    is identified by the device accessor number. Subsequent channels
    with a configuration specified in the @tt cfg array of the request
    are selected by the @tt chan_mask field. The least significant bit
    of the mask corresponds to the API instance number given by the
    accessor and must be set. The size of the array must match the
    number of bits set in the @tt chan_mask field.

    The @ref dev_pwm_rq_s::mask field selects the parameters that are
    updated. A single call to @this, can set the configuration of
    multiple channels atomically if this is supported by the the
    hardware.

    Depending on the hardware design, some parameters may be shared
    between channels. This is usually the case for the frequency
    parameters. The configuration of all started channels with a
    shared parameter must be updated at the same time. A channel is
    considered started when it's duty cycle is neither 0 nor 1. In any
    case, if the value of a shared parameter is not updated simultaneously
    for all started channels, the @tt -ENOTSUP error is reported.

    The duty cycle of channels is set to 0 when the driver is
    initialized. The @ref device_start function can be called in order
    to keep the internal counter running when channels are not
    started.

    The @tt kr is executed upon completion. In case of error, the @tt
    dev_request_s::kr kroutine is called with the @tt error field set
    appropriately. If at least one error condition is detected for a
    single channel no configuration is performed at all on other
    channels.
