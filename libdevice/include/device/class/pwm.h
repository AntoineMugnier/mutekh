   @csee DRIVER_CLASS_PWM

   This device class API allows configuration of multiple PWM channels
   provided by a single device.

   The channel mapping exposed by the driver can be specified in the
   device resources. When no mapping resources is specified, the API
   channel indices follows the hardware channel order.

/** @This configures some PWM channels. Channels are selected by the
    @ref dev_pwm_rq_s::chan_mask field.

    The @ref dev_pwm_rq_s::param_mask field selects the parameters
    that are updated. A single call to @this, can set the
    configuration of multiple channels atomically if this is supported
    by the the hardware.

    Depending on the hardware design, some parameters may be shared
    between channels. This is usually the case for the frequency
    parameters. The @tt -ENOTSUP error is reported when such a
    parameter is not changed for all channels at the same time.

    A channel output has no transitions when the duty cycle
    is either 0 or 1. The duty cycle of channels is set to 0 when
    the driver is initialized.

    The @ref device_start function must be called in order to start
    operation. All channels are started simultaneously when the device
    is started.

    The PWM output signal will change as soon as possible. This may
    occur after the return of the function.
