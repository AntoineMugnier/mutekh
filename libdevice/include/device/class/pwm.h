    If the function returns 0, then the configuration request is consistent.
    However, this does not guarantee that the configuration can be
    applied. The @tt error field must be used inside the kroutine to check
    effectiveness of the configuration.

    The value of the @tt mask defines the parameters that must be took
    into account for the configuration. Depending on the PWM channel share
    the controller with other channel, the change of the frequency may
    affect other channels. This is architecture dependant.

    The @tt mode field defines the way the PWM controller and channels may
    be updated. Depending on the chosen mode, a unique accessor (i.e.
    task) can alter the configuration or, at the opposite, everyone can
    alter the configuration. @see dev_pwm_mode_e. If the mode is
    @ref #DEV_PWM_MODE_EXCL, then the request fifo is filtered to consume
    request pushed by the owning accessor. The request order is kept stable.

    If the configuration alter the duty cycle or the polarity of the channel,
    the @tt chan field must be initialized accordingly, otherwise the
    configuration may have unexpected behavior.

    If the @tt error field value is -EINVAL, the configuration failed to
    be applied.
