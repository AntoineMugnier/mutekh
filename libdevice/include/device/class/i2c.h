  @short I2C bus controller driver API
  @index {I2C bus controller} {Device classes}
  @csee DRIVER_CLASS_I2C_CTRL

  This class enables driving I2C bus controllers. I2C controllers may
  be used from the application code but are most often used from
  device drivers of slave I2C devices.

  A generic I2C requests scheduler is provided which allows sharing a
  single I2C bus by multiple slave devices. This has been designed to
  support concurrence of access from multiple slave drivers.

  @section {I2C controller driver API}

  Unlike most driver classes, I2C bus controller drivers are not able
  to queue more than one request at the same time. They provide the
  @ref dev_i2c_ctrl_transfer_t function which starts a single I2C
  transfer on the BUS, if not already busy. A deferred @ref
  kroutine_s is scheduled when the transfer is over.

  Device drivers of I2C slaves must not use this driver low level API
  directly as it does not allow sharing the bus with other
  slaves. The scheduler API described below is built on top of the
  present driver API. It requires the controller driver to store an
  @ref dev_i2c_ctrl_context_s {I2C scheduler context} object in the
  device private data.

  @end section

  @section {I2C request scheduler}

  This API allows scheduling multiple I2C requests which will be
  processed once the bus becomes idle. This allows sharing a I2C bus
  between multiple slave device drivers and the application.

  Two types of requests can be scheduled concurrently:
  transaction requests and bytecode based requests. Both are covered
  in the following sections.

  @section {I2C transaction request}

  An I2C transaction is composed of multiple elementary transfers which
  perform multiple read or write operations atomically on the bus.
  A transaction begins implicitly with a START condition
  and ends with a STOP condition. A RESTART condition is also implicitly
  generated when the type of successive transfers are different. Successive
  transfers with the same type are seen as a single transfer on the bus.

  A transaction may be started on the I2C bus by calling the @ref
  dev_i2c_transaction_start function. A deferred @ref kroutine_s
  is scheduled when the transaction is over.

  When the controller is used from the device driver of a slave device,
  the @ref dev_drv_i2c_transaction_init helper function may be used to
  initialize a request from the appropriate @xref {Device
  resources}{resource entries} of the slave device.

  @csee #CONFIG_DEVICE_I2C_TRANSACTION
  @end section

  @section {I2C bytecode request}

  Driving a I2C slave device often requires many small transactions
  with some control depending on values read from the slave. Due to
  the asynchronous nature of the transaction requests API, this may
  be cumbersome to write a driver which use deferred execution of
  many small functions between transactions. A blocking C API would
  be easier to use but is not option as this would imply allocation
  of a thread stack for each slave device driver.

  Moreover some slave may have some specific requirements, either
  yielding or locking the bus for some time between transfers. Sharing
  the bus between such slaves without relying on specific code
  requires expressing timing and locking constraints to the scheduler
  for each transfer.

  These issues are addressed by providing an I2C specific bytecode
  based on the Mutekh @xref {generic bytecode}. A bytecode request
  comes with a bytecode program containing some synchronous I2C
  transfer instructions as well as time delay and gpio instructions.
  Generic bytecode instructions can be used for control. The bytecode
  can then be used to write some I2C macros operations specific to a
  given slave. A slave device driver may use several different bytecode
  routines to perform its task.

  A bytecode request may be started on the I2C bus by calling the
  @ref dev_i2c_bytecode_start function. The I2C request scheduler is
  designed to handle time delays and switching between scheduled
  bytecode programs as appropriate. A bytecode requests terminates
  when its associated bytecode program terminates. A deferred @ref
  kroutine_s is scheduled when this occurs.

  When the controller is used from a slave device driver, the @ref
  dev_drv_i2c_bytecode_init helper function may be used to
  initialize a request from the appropriate @xref {Device
  resources}{resource entries} of the slave device.

  @end table

  @section {i2c_delay}
  This instruction setup a delay starting when the instruction is executed. The
  execution of the bytecode will not be suspended. When a @xref {i2c_yield}
  instruction is encountered, the execution is suspended if the delay has not
  elapsed at that time. The @cref #CONFIG_DEVICE_I2C_BYTECODE_TIMER must be
  defined in order to use this instruction.

  The delay given in the register is expressed timer unit.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_nodelay}
  This instruction reset the current delay so that the @xref {i2c_yield}
  instruction will not suspend the execution of the bytecode if there are no
  other request to process.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_yield}
  This instruction allows other requests targeting slave on the same i2c bus to
  be processed. This cannot be used if a transaction has been started until a
  STOP condition is generated.
  If a @xref {i2c_delay} instruction has been executed previously, the bytecode
  execution will not resume until the delay has elapsed.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_yieldc}
  This works like @xref {i2c_yield} but the delay can be canceled by @ref
  device_i2c_bytecode_wakeup. When the delay is canceled, the next instruction
  is skipped.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_yield_delay}
  This instruction acts as @xref {i2c_delay} followed by @xref {i2c_yield}.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_yieldc_delay}
  This instruction acts as @xref {i2c_delay} followed by @xref {i2c_yieldc}.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_rd* and i2c_wr*}
    @label{i2c_rw_instructions}
  This schedules a transfer on the i2c bus. The third argument is of
  type @ref dev_i2c_bc_completion_e which indicates how this transfer
  ends. In the case of the first transfer of the transaction, a start
  condition is generated on the bus.

  When the transaction is split in multiple transfer instructions, the
  transfer may actually not be performed before the @ref
  DEV_I2C_BC_STOP instruction. In case of a write instruction, the
  memory buffer or registers containing the output data must remain
  valid. In case of a read instruction, the memory buffer or registers
  used to store the input data may not be updated immediately.

  Successive @ref DEV_I2C_BC_CONTINUOUS transfers in different
  directions are forbidden. If a transfer error is reported by the i2c
  controller, the bytecode is terminated and the request ends with an
  error.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_rd*c and i2c_wr*c}
  These conditional instructions are similar to other read and write
  instructions. If a NAK condition is detected on the bus, the next
  instruction is not skipped. When the transfer is successful, the
  next instruction is skipped. These instructions are usually used
  with the @ref DEV_I2C_BC_STOP value as third argument. @ref
  DEV_I2C_BC_CONTINUOUS and @ref DEV_I2C_BC_RESTART are
  forbidden. @ref DEV_I2C_BC_CONTINUOUS_SYNC and @ref
  DEV_I2C_BC_RESTART_SYNC are not supported by all controllers.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_rdm* and i2c_wrm*}
  These instuctions read data to memory and write data from memory. The buffer
  address and buffer byte length are passed via registers.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_rdr* and i2c_wrr*}
  These instuctions respectively read and write the specified amount of bytes
  to virtual registers. The format of data in registers is hardware dependent
  and needs to be converted by using the @tt pack* and @tt unpack* @xref {Generic
  instruction set} {generic instructions}. The transfered bytes are stored in contiguous
  registers, using at most one register for each group of 4 bytes. The index of
  the first register used to store the data and the number of bytes are expected
  as operands.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_gpioset}
  This instruction sets the value of a gpio pin. The @cref
  #CONFIG_DEVICE_I2C_BYTECODE_GPIO token must be defined.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_gpioget}
  This instruction gets the value of a gpio pin.
  @end section

  @section {i2c_gpiomode}
  This instruction mode the value of a gpio pin.
  @end section

  @end section
