   @short SPI bus controller driver API
   @index {SPI bus controller} {Device classes}
   @csee DRIVER_CLASS_SPI_CTRL

   This class enables driving SPI bus controllers. SPI controllers may
   be used from the application code but are most often used from
   device drivers of slave SPI devices.

   A generic SPI requests scheduler is provided which allows sharing a
   single SPI bus by multiple slave devices. This has been designed to
   support concurrence of access from multiple slave drivers.

   @section {SPI driver API}

   Unlike most driver classes, SPI bus controller drivers are not able
   to queue more than one request at the same time. They provide the
   @ref dev_spi_ctrl_transfer_t function which starts a single SPI
   transfer on the BUS, if not already busy. A deferred @ref
   kroutine_s is scheduled when the transfer is over.

   The @ref dev_spi_ctrl_config_t function allows setting the bus
   speed and modes for the next transfer.

   Device drivers of SPI slaves must not use this driver low level API
   directly as it does not allow sharing the bus with other
   slaves. The scheduler API described below is builtin on top of the
   present driver API. It requires the controller driver to store a
   @ref dev_spi_ctrl_context_s {spi scheduler context} object in the
   device private data for use by libdevice.

   @end section

   @section {SPI request scheduler}

   This API allows scheduling multiple SPI requests which will be
   processed once the bus becomes idle. This allows sharing a SPI bus
   between multiple slave device drivers and the application.

   Two types of requests can be scheduled concrrently: single
   transaction requests and bytecode based requests. Both are covered
   in the following sections.

   @section {SPI transaction request}

   A transaction is a single SPI transfer processed by the controller
   with an optional chip selection during the transfer.  The chip
   select operation may rely either on the bus controller or on a gpio
   controller. The scheduler will take care of driving the chip select
   signal when the transfer actually takes place.

   A transaction may be started on the SPI bus by calling the @ref
   dev_spi_transaction_start function. A deferred @ref kroutine_s
   is scheduled when the transaction is over.

   When the controller is used from a slave device driver, the @ref
   dev_drv_spi_transaction_init helper function may be used to
   initialize a request from the appropriate @xref {Device
   resources}{resource entries} of the slave device.

   @csee #CONFIG_DEVICE_SPI_TRANSACTION
   @end section

   @section {SPI bytecode request}

   Driving a SPI slave device often requires many small transactions
   with some control depending on values read from the slave. Due to
   the asynchronous nature of the transaction requests API, this may
   be cumbersome to write a driver which use deferred execution of
   many small functions between transactions. A blocking C API would
   be easier to use but is not option as this would imply allocation
   of a thread stack for each slave device driver.

   Moreover, the SPI bus interface being a de facto standard, some
   slave may have some specific requirements, either yielding or
   locking the bus for some time between transfers. Sharing the bus
   between such slaves without relying on specific code requires
   expressing timing and locking constraints to the scheduler for each
   transfer.

   These issues are addressed by providing a SPI specific bytecode
   based on the Mutekh @xref {generic bytecode}{}. A bytecode request
   come with a bytecode program containing some synchronous SPI
   transfer instructions as well as time delay, chip selection and
   gpio instructions. Generic bytecode instructions can be used for
   control. The bytecode can then be used to write some SPI macros
   operations specific to a given slave. A slave device driver may use
   several different bytecode routines to perform its task.

   A bytecode request may be started on the SPI bus by calling the
   @ref dev_spi_bytecode_start function. The SPI request scheduler
   designed to handle time delays and switching between scheduled
   bytecode programs as appropriate.  A bytecode requests terminates
   when its associated bytecode program terminates. A deferred @ref
   kroutine_s is scheduled when this occurs.

   When the controller is used from a slave device driver, the @ref
   dev_drv_spi_bytecode_init helper function may be used to
   initialize a request from the appropriate @xref {Device
   resources}{resource entries} of the slave device.

   @end table

   @section {spi_nodelay}
   This instruction reset the current delay so that the
   @xref {spi_yield} instruction will not suspend the execution of the
   bytecode if there are no other request to process.
   @end section

   @section {spi_deadline}
   This instruction setup a deadline deadline using the @ref dev_timer_value_t
   pointed at the address in the provided register. The execution of next
   instructions follows the same semantics as @xref{spi_delay}.

   The deadline is expressed in timer units.

   The @cref #CONFIG_DEVICE_SPI_BYTECODE_TIMER token must be defined in order
   to use this instruction.
   @end section

   @section {spi_delay}
   This instruction setup a delay starting when the instruction is
   executed. The execution of the bytecode will not be suspended. When
   a @xref {spi_yield} or @xref {spi_wait} instruction is
   encountered, the execution is suspended if the delay has not
   elapsed at that time. The @cref #CONFIG_DEVICE_SPI_BYTECODE_TIMER token
   must be defined in order to use this instruction.

   The delay given in the register is expressed timer unit.
   @end section

   @section {spi_timestamp}
   This instruction fetches the current value of the timer associated with the
   bytecode virtual machine. The timer value is copied in the
   @ref dev_timer_value_t pointed at the address in the provided register.

   The @cref #CONFIG_DEVICE_SPI_BYTECODE_TIMER token must be defined in order
   to use this instruction.
   @end section

   @section {spi_elapsed}
   This conditional instruction skips the next instruction if the timer
   deadline setup by @xref {spi_delay} or @xref {spi_deadline} has not been reached.
   @end section

   @section {spi_elapsed_r}
   This conditional instruction skips the next instruction if the timer
   deadline pointed by the specified register has not been reached.
   @end section

   @section {spi_yield}
   This instruction allows other requests targeting slave on the same
   SPI bus to be processed. The chip select must be in released state
   when this instruction is executed.

   If a @xref {spi_delay} instruction has been executed previously,
   the bytecode execution will not resume until the delay has elapsed.
   @end section

   @section {spi_yieldc}
   This works like @xref {spi_yield} but the delay can be canceled by
   @ref dev_spi_bytecode_wakeup. When the delay is canceled, the
   next instruction is skipped.
   @end section

   @section {spi_sleep}
   This instruction allows other requests targeting slave on the same
   SPI bus to be processed. The @ref dev_spi_bytecode_wakeup function
   must be called in order to resume execution of the bytecode.
   @end section

   @section {spi_yield_delay}
   This instruction acts as @xref {spi_delay} followed by @xref {spi_yield}.
   @end section

   @section {spi_yield_deadline}
   This instruction acts as @xref {spi_deadline} followed by @xref {spi_yield}.
   @end section

   @section {spi_yieldc_delay}
   This works like @xref {spi_yield_delay} but the delay can be
   canceled by @ref dev_spi_bytecode_wakeup.
   @end section

   @section {spi_yieldc_deadline}
   This works like @xref {spi_yield_deadline} but the delay can be
   canceled by @ref dev_spi_bytecode_wakeup.
   @end section

   @section {spi_wait}
   This instruction instructs the controller to wait before resuming
   execution of the bytecode. No other request can be serviced on the
   same bus during the delay. Use @xref {spi_yield} instead if access
   of the bus by other devices is allowed.

   A previous @xref {spi_delay} instruction must be used to setup the delay.
   @end section

   @section {spi_wait_delay}
   This instruction acts as @xref {spi_delay} followed by @xref {spi_wait}.
   @end section

   @section {spi_wait_deadline}
   This instruction acts as @xref {spi_deadline} followed by @xref {spi_wait}.
   @end section

   @section {spi_width}
   This instruction set the SPI word width and the bit
   order in the @ref dev_spi_ctrl_config_s object associated to
   the request. The width value is a constant between 1 and 32. The order
   is MSB first when @tt order is 1.
   @end section

   @section {spi_brate}
   This instruction sets the bit transfer rate in the @ref
   dev_spi_ctrl_config_s object associated to the request. The register must
   contain the new bitrate value in bits per second.
   @end section

   @section {spi_swp}
   This instructions transfer up to 16 bytes between some virtual machine
   registers and a SPI slave. The operands are the source register,
   the destination register, the transfer byte length and the chip
   select operation.

   Available chip select operations are:
   @list
     @item @tt CS_START, @tt CS_CONTINUE: see @ref DEV_SPI_CS_SET_NOP
     @item @tt CS_END, @tt CS_PULSE: see @ref DEV_SPI_CS_SET_CLR
   @end list

   The format of data in registers is hardware dependent and needs to
   be converted by using the @tt pack* and @tt unpack* @xref {Generic
   instruction set} {generic instructions}. The transfered bytes are
   stored in contiguous registers, using at most one register for each
   group of 4 bytes. The index of the first register used to store the
   data and the number of bytes are expected as operands.
   @end section

   @section {spi_wr}
   The @tt spi_wr instruction is similar to @xref{spi_swp} but discards
   data read from the slave.
   @end section

   @section {spi_rd}
   The @tt spi_rd instruction is similar to @xref{spi_swp} but send
   padding bytes with the @tt 0xff value.
   @end section

   @section {spi_swpm}
   This instruction reads and writes multiple SPI words using two
   buffers of bytes. The address of the read buffer is given by the
   value of the @tt rar register operand and the address of the write
   buffer is given by the value of the @tt raw register operand. These
   two registers must be contiguous. The amount of SPI words to
   transfer is given by the @tt rl register operand.

   The last operand specifies the chip select operation:
   @list
     @item @tt CS_START, @tt CS_CONTINUE: see @ref DEV_SPI_CS_SET_NOP
     @item @tt CS_END, @tt CS_PULSE: see @ref DEV_SPI_CS_SET_CLR
     @item @tt CS_NOP: see @ref DEV_SPI_CS_NOP_NOP
     @item @tt CS_DESELECT: see @ref DEV_SPI_CS_CLR_NOP
   @end list
   @end section

   @section {spi_wrm}
   The @tt spi_wrm instruction is similar to @xref{spi_swpm} but discards
   data read from the slave.
   @end section

   @section {spi_rdm}
   The @tt spi_rdm instruction is similar to @xref{spi_swpm} but send
   padding bytes with the @tt 0xff value.
   @end section

   @section {spi_pad}
   The @tt spi_pad instruction is similar to @xref{spi_swpm} but
   discards data read from the slave and send padding bytes. Four packed
   bytes are used as padding pattern.
   @end section

   @section {spi_cs}
   The @tt spi_cs instruction performs a zero length transfer,
   only updating the chip select signal as specified.
   @end section

   @section {spi_gpioset}
   This instruction sets the value of a gpio pin. The @cref
   #CONFIG_DEVICE_SPI_BYTECODE_GPIO token must be defined.
   The first operand selects the pin as an index of the @ref
   dev_spi_ctrl_bytecode_rq_s::gpio_map array.
   @end section

   @section {spi_gpioget}
   This instruction gets the value of a gpio pin.
   The first operand selects the pin as an index of the @ref
   dev_spi_ctrl_bytecode_rq_s::gpio_map array.
   @end section

   @section {spi_gpiomode}
   This instruction mode the value of a gpio pin.
   The first operand selects the pin as an index of the @ref
   dev_spi_ctrl_bytecode_rq_s::gpio_map array.
   @end section
