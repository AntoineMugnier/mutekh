/**
  @file
  @module {Core::Devices support library}
  @short Direct memory access driver API
  @index {Direct memory access} {Device classes}
  @csee DRIVER_CLASS_DMA

  This class of device provides a generic API for accessing DMA
  controllers from other device drivers.

  Transfer between memory and device registers are both supported. A
  @ref dev_dma_rq_s {DMA operation} request may perform multiple
  transfers of the same @ref dev_dma_rq_type_e {type}. A request
  embeds an array of @ref dev_dma_desc_s {transfer descriptors}. Each
  transfer entry specifies the addresses, size, stride and access
  width that must be used to perform the copy. It is possible to loop
  over the array of descriptors during a single request.

  These modes of operation are supported:
  @list
  @item In continuous mode, a callback is invoked after
    each transfer of the request, letting the initiator decide if the
    transfer must go on.
  @item In single shot mode, a callback is invoked when the whole
    operation is over. A loop count is provided when the requested
    is submitted, allowing the hardware to perform the whole operation
    without software intervention.
  @end list

  A per request channel mask is used to specifies the channels that
  can be used to perform an operation.
