   @short Character device driver API

   @section {Description}

   Character device class abstracts access to a byte-stream oriented
   device.

   Two main types of requests are available on this driver: Read and
   Write operations. Some variants operations exist as defined in @ref
   dev_char_rq_type_e.

   @end section

   @section {Example}

   The following code reads 32 characters from a device, but accepts
   to get less if less data is available from the underlying hardware:

   @code
   struct device_char_s char_dev;

   // Lookup accessor for char_dev here...

   uint8_t data[32];
   struct dev_char_rq_s rq =
   {
       .type = DEV_CHAR_READ_PARTIAL,
       .data = data,
       .size = sizeof(data),
   };

   kroutine_init_deferred(&rq.base.kr, my_callback);

   DEVICE_OP(&char_dev, request, &rq);
   @end code

   @end section

   @section {Request Completion Information}

   Driver updates @tt data and @tt size fields of the request in order
   to indicate what is left to transfer.

   @end section

   When no error is reported, the @tt data and @tt size fields are

   are left in an undefined state when an error is reported.

   The following error codes are valid:

   @list
     @item @tt -ENOENT: The targeted sub-device does not exists.
       This is only reported when the driver implements sub-devices.
     @item @tt -ENOTSUP: The request operation is not supported by
       the device.
     @item @tt -EIO: Temporary or permanent hardware error.
     @item @tt -EPIPE: Data have been lost due to a buffer overflow or
       a sync error condition. This error is reported once.
     @item @tt -ENOSPC: The request date size is too small to store the
       incoming frame or the outgoing frame is to large to be processed
       by the device. This error is reported once.
     @item @tt -EBADDATA: The incoming data has been dropped due to a
