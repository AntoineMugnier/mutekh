   @This is the device driver initialization function type. This
   function allocates device private data and initialize the
   hardware. It will be called before using any other functions on the
   device.

   The device initialization status will be updated depending on the
   return value of this function:

   @list
     @item If 0 is returned, the device status changes to @ref
        DEVICE_INIT_DONE.

     @item The first call to this function might not be able to fully
       complete the initialization of the device. In this case, it
       should return @tt -EAGAIN to indicate that initialization will
       complete later. The device status will then be changed to @ref
       DEVICE_INIT_ONGOING. The initialization may complete either
       when the @ref device_async_init_done is called by the driver or
       when the dev_init_t function is called again. The later occurs
       when some progress are made on initialization of related
       devices and the @ref DRIVER_FLAGS_INIT_RETRY flag of the driver
       is set. The @ref device_init_is_partial function should be used
       to test for the initial invocation.

     @item If an error is returned and the driver has not invoked the
       @ref device_init_enable_api function, the status is changed
       to @ref DEVICE_INIT_FAILED. The driver must have released all
       resource associated to the device in this case as the @ref
       dev_cleanup_t function will not be called.

     @item If an error is returned but some classes have been
       reported as initialized, the status is changed to @ref
       DEVICE_INIT_PARTIAL.
   @end list

   The @ref DRIVER_FLAGS_NO_DEPEND flag can be used so that this
   function is called even if some resource dependencies are not
   satisfied. The driver is then responsible for testing missing
   dependencies. In this case the @tt cl_missing mask parameter
   indicates any driver classes related to a missing resource
   dependencies.

   The @ref DRIVER_FLAGS_EARLY_INIT flag can be used so that this
   function is called early during startup. Some kernel service can
   not be used in this case, especially, asynchronous initialization
   can not be used.
