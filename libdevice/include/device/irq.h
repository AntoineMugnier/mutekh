/** @This can be used to include an irq resource entry in a static

    An interrupt controller device path must be specifed in a previous
    @ref DEV_RES_DEV_PARAM resource named @em icu. The device path is
    relative to the device owning the resource entry.

    This entry specifies how an output irq wire (source) of the
    device is connected to an input (sink) of the interrupt
    controller. This is used to connect software irq end-points
    of the two device drivers.

    A mask of irq trigger modes supported by the source is specified.
    When the linking occurs, a single mode will be selected based on
    what is supported by both the sink and the source end-points. If
    zero is used here, no particular mode will be configured and the
    driver will be responsible for updating the sense mode of the sink.

    When the trigger mode is @ref DEV_IRQ_SENSE_ID_BUS, the logical
    irq number associated to the device on the irq bus must be given
    in @tt irq_id_ . Zero is used if the hardware irq link is a single
    wire.

    For interrupt controllers with multiple source end-points, irq
    routing must be configured. A single output is used when the irq
    is triggered. Which source end-point is actually selected may be
    choosen statically or dynamically by the implementation among
    allowed routes defined by the route mask parameter.

    In order to have the same irq forwarded to multiple controllers
    simultaneously, the @ref #CONFIG_DEVICE_IRQ_MULTI_SINK token must
    be defined and multiple irq resource entries must be provided.

    In order to connect multiple interrupts wires to the same
    controller input, the @ref #CONFIG_DEVICE_IRQ_SHARING token must
    be defined.
