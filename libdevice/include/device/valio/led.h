/* This interface is used to drive mono, bi or tricolor leds. 
   The @tt lum defines the luminosity in range [0-255] for each
   emitter.

   For a RGB led:

     RED   : @tt lum[0]
     GREEN : @tt lum[1]
     BLUE  : @tt lum[2]
   
   For others leds, luminosity of each emitter fill up
   @tt lum starting from @tt lum[0].
   For example, luminosity of a mono led is defined by
   @tt luminosity[0].
