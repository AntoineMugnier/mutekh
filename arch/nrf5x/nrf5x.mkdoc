@moduledef {nRF5X platform} {Platforms}

Nordic's nRF51 and nRF52 architectures are supported for most of their
hardware features.  Most development boards are supported as well.

@section tP {Drivers}

  @section {Clocks}
    Clocking in nRF5x is quite simple because most clock dependencies
    are handled automatically by hardware, and because there are only
    two clock sources, using fixed frequencies.  Nevertheless, clock
    driver handles many tedious aspects of the clocking of the device:

    @list
      @item it handles LFCLK calibration when there is no external
        crystal available,
      @item it monitors temperature to see whether to calibrate LFCLK,
      @item it tries to delay LFCLK calibration to a later time where
        HFCLK runs,
      @item it handles switching source for LFCLK when requested, and
        indicates when precision changes,
      @item it handles switching source for HFCLK when requested, and
        indicates when precision changes.
    @end list

    Clock tree is designed to be as straightforward as possible to
    use. Clock driver exports two clocks:
    @list
      @item @ref {NRF_CLOCK_LF} {Low Frequency clock, with unspecified
        precision},
      @item @ref {NRF_CLOCK_HF} {High Frequency clock, with
        unspecified precision}.
    @end list

    Clock driver implements two muxes (one for HFCLK, the other for
    LFCLK).  Both can select external crystal or internal RC.  If
    accuracy selected for internal low frequency RC is below 250ppm,
    calibration is automatically enabled (if @ref
    #CONFIG_DRIVER_NRF5X_CLOCK_LFRC_CAL is selected).

    Clock driver also implements throttling.  It can be used to
    dynamically change clock sources and accuracy.
  @end section

  @section {GPIO}
    GPIO controller implements both the GPIO class and the ICU class,
    so that an external peripheral can use a GPIO as an interrupt
    sink.  This feature uses GPIOTE channels in Event mode.  @xsee
    {GPIOTE}.
  @end section

  @section {PWM}
    PWM is a composite device using a timer, PPIs and GPIOTE channels.
    GPIOTE are used in Task mode.  @xsee {GPIOTE}.
  @end section

  @section {UART}
    UART is implemented as a Character Device, fully interrupt driven.
    Optionnally, nRF UART driver may also be enabled to handle the
    UART class to support dynamic port reconfiguration.

    Printk support is also implemented, it has transparent coexistence
    support with char/uart device driver on the same hardware block.

    Declaration of UART device is board-specific.
  @end section

  @section {I2C}
    Hardware I2C block is available with full interrupt support.  It
    only supports master operation, this is a hardware limitation.
  @end section

  @section {SPI}
    Hardware SPI-master block is available with full interrupt
    support.

    Slave SPI block is unsupported.
  @end section

  @section {RTC}
    RTC is supported as a Timer device.  When driver is compiled in,
    RTC1 instance is declared built-in as "rtc1".  RTC0 is left
    available for BLE radio driver.  User may instantiate RTC0 on its
    own if radio driver is unused.
  @end section

  @section {NVMC}
    Flash controller is implemented with two concurrent classes:
    @list
      @item Memory controller,
    @end list

    Flash access is polled and fully blocking when writing.  This is a
    hardware-enforced requirement.
  @end section

  @section {Timer}
    Timers are implemented as Timer devices.  When driver is enabled,
    Timer1 is instantiated as "timer1".  Timer0 is left available for
    BLE radio driver.  User may instantiate Timer0 on its own if radio
    driver is unused.
  @end section

  @section {BLE Radio}
    BLE Radio driver implements various network layers, depending on
    the @ref {+Bluetooth Low Energy library} configuration:

    @list
      @item @ref {@ble/net/adv.h} {Advertising} layer,
      @item @ref {@ble/net/scanner.h} {Scanner} layer (Oberver,
        Scanner, Initiator),
      @item @ref {@ble/net/phy.h} {Slave},
      @item @ref {@ble/net/phy.h} {Master}.
    @end list

    Link-layer (LL demux, Crypto and LLCP) is handled through generic
    libble network layers.

    This driver uses 3 hardware blocks: @tt Radio, @tt RTC0 and @tt
    Timer0.  @tt Timer0 and @tt RTC0 blocks may not be changed to
    others as there are some hardwired @tt PPIs between them.

    Nordic assigns Static Random addresses to its chips.  Driver
    retrieves device address from @tt FICR.
  @end section
  
  @section {AES}
    Hardware AES encrypt block is supported through a crypto driver
    which supports 4 functions:

    @list
      @item Basic AES block encrypt,
      @item a custom AES-based seedable DRBG,
      @item BLE-CCM mode (it only supports CCM operation with
        BLE-specific parameters),
      @item AES-CMAC, a keyed-hash algorithm used in Bluetooth
    @end list

    As most operations are fast and shorter than an interrupt
    round-trip, cryptographical operations use a @ref
    {dev_request_dlqueue_s} {delayed queued} to handle request from
    interruptible mode, in a busy-wait manner.
  @end section

  @section {RNG}
    Hardware Thermal noise random number generator is supported as a
    Cryptographic device yielding a random stream without context.
    Derivation compensation is enabled.

    This driver should only be used to seed another RNG.
  @end section

  @section {ADC}
    ADC is handled through relevant @ref {VALIO_ADC_VALUE} {Valio}
    @ref {valio_adc_group_s} {subclass}.  Analog pin configuration is
    done at driver instantiation time.
  @end section

@end section

@section tP {Unsupported hardware features}
  @list
    @item @tt {SPI Slave}: MutekH has no driver class for this;
    @item @tt AAR: This is of no usefulness for current MutekH BLE
      stack implementation;
    @item @tt WDT: Watchdog is not a kernel feature;
    @item @tt QDEC: MutekH has no such device definition yet,
    @item @tt nRF52 UARTE, SPIM, TWIE blocks with EasyDMA,
    @item @tt nRF52 NFC tag interface,
    @item @tt nRF52 I2S and PDM audio interfaces.
  @end list
@end section

@section tP {Boards}

  @section {nRF51822-Dongle}
    PCA10000 is the most simple board.  UART is driven as a character
    device, RGB LED can be controlled through GPIOs or PWM drivers.
  @end section

  @section {nRF51822-DK nRFgo boards}
    PCA10004 and PCA10005 are actually the same boards from a software
    point of view.  Only difference is on the PCB antenna vs. SMA connector.

    nRFgo mother board has not been explored.
  @end section

  @section {nRF51822-mKit}
    This board is mBed-based development board for nRF51.  It has all

    (including LEDs and buttons) are left to user code.
  @end section

  @section {nRF51-SmartRemote}
    PCA20002 is daugther-board for SmartRemote.  This board only
    contains the nRF51 chip and an I2C extender (PCA9557).  It is
    meant to be plugged to a SmartRemote motherboard.

    In PCA20002 defintion, all SmartRemote peripherals are declared as
    well.  Not all of them are driven by MutekH yet, though.
  @end section

  @section {nRF51-Beacon}
    PCA20006 contains no other IC than the nRF51.  UART is declared as
    defined in schematic (goes to tag-connect).  RGB-LED and buttons
    are left to user code.
